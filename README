USAGE
 
	Running:         python3 ann.py [iris-database]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FILES

	network_class.py: Contains the implementation of the NeuralNetwork class
				     which contains attributes such as train_info, test_info,
				     and weights etc.

	ann.py:          Contains the code the for training the neural network,
					 which uses forward and backward propagation, the code
					 for testing the neural network, and the code for gettting
					 user query.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES

	- Our implementation trains the neural network until it reaches an accuracy
	  level greater than 90%

	- We used 35 as our Neural Network Epoch, and 0.7 as our Learning Rate

	- After training the neural network, our program asks for user input to
	  manually test the neural network and makes a prediction according to
	  the user input
